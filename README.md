# Data Visualization in Computational Biology (Route 2)

## ✅ Overview
This project visualizes simple biological cell growth data over time using Python.

## ✅ Dataset
The file `cells.csv` contains:
- time (hours)
- cell_count (number of cells)

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open terminal
2. Move into project folder
3. Run:

   python3 analysis.py

## ✅ Visualizations
- Line plot
- Scatter plot
- Bar chart

## ✅ Interpretation
The number of cells increases as time increases.
Cell growth starts slowly, then increases rapidly, showing exponential growth.
This behavior is typical for healthy cells with sufficient nutrients.

## ✅ Resources & Plan
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib
- Time to complete: ~3 hours
- Cost: $0
- Hardware: Laptop

## ✅ Results
Three plot files are saved:
- plot_line.png
- plot_scatter.png
- plot_bar.png
